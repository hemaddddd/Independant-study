# Independant-study

I copied all the works from the mid-term project and I added the new dialogue system, in this system, player can choose different options in the conversation and have different results of the conversation. 

And I lost most of my works because the system won't be able to save them correctly, and most of them just lost :(
But I spend 30 minutes and fixed it :) so never mind
